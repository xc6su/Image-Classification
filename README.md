# Image-Classification
Medical imaging technique is developing fast over the past few decades. Automatic recognition and classification of histopathological images has been a hot field in both research and practice. As hundreds of images could be generated from a medical imaging device per day, it could save physiciansâ€™ time and labor force by analysing images on the machine.  
	In this experiment, bovine lung H&E stained images are going to be learnt. Two sets of training data are provided: 15  pictures contain inflammation lung cells and 15 pictures contain normal lung cells. 20 testing pictures are going to be classified based on features from training data. The goal is to automatically recognize pictures with and without inflamed cells.
